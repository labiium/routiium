# rust-toolchain.toml
#
# Purpose:
# - Pin a minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for local development and reproducible CI.
# - Ensure required components (rustfmt, clippy) are available by default.
#
# Notes:
# - Updated to 1.85.0 to support dependencies requiring edition2024 features
# - CI may additionally test on the latest stable toolchain; this pin guarantees
#   that the code remains compatible with the declared MSRV.
# - Developers can temporarily override with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable` or by using
#   `rustup override set <toolchain>` in their workspace if needed.
#
# Changelog:
# - 2024: Updated from 1.82.0 to 1.85.0 to fix CI/CD build failures
#   (home crate 0.5.12 requires edition2024 support)
