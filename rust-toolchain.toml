# rust-toolchain.toml
#
# Purpose:
# - Use stable Rust toolchain for maximum compatibility
# - Ensure required components (rustfmt, clippy) are available by default.
#
# Notes:
# - Using "stable" channel to automatically get latest stable Rust version
# - This ensures compatibility with all dependencies including AWS SDK
# - CI may additionally test on specific versions for MSRV verification
# - Developers can temporarily override with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=<version>` or by using
#   `rustup override set <toolchain>` in their workspace if needed.
#
# Changelog:
# - 2024: Changed from pinned version to "stable" to resolve AWS SDK compatibility
#   (AWS SDK packages require rustc 1.88+, using stable ensures latest version)
